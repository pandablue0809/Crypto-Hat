# Crypto-Hat

Crypto-Hat is a blockchain-powered platform where you can trade NFTs. ðŸŒŸ It's an NFT marketplace built with JavaScript, React, Next.js, Web3.js, Solidity, and styled using Tailwind CSS.
> This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
